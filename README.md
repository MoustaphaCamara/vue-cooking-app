# Cooking App made with Vue3 in Vite

I first made use of the MealDbAPI when learning React. Since I am now learning Vue, I figured why not try again with this API I already know so I can focus on how to handle Vue syntax & props passing through components, rather than exploring a new API. That is to come, next.
This is my first app with VueJs.
